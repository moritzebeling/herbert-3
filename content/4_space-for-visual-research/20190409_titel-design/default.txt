Body: For this post we will focus on a process that will help improve planning for the future. behavior change is centered around understanding past behavior, and this process is as simple as that with a catch. if you are planning things for the next year or few months you donâ€™t want to dig deep into the past because it opens things that while although important will detach you from your focus of planning for the immediate future.
