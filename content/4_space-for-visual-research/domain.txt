Description: The Space for Visual Research was established at the Bauhaus University in Weimar in 2013 as a workshop and laboratory for experimental research into new graphic, abstract, and visual worlds. The Spaceâ€™s mission is to support the exploratory urge for new aesthetics, in particular by empowering design students to create their own individual imagery.
